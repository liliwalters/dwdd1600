        <h1>Declaration of Independence</h1>
        <h2>What it Says</h2>
        <p>The Declaration of Independence was designed for multiple audiences: <em>the King, the colonists, and the
                world.</em>
            It was also designed to multitask. Its goals were to rally the troops, win foreign allies, and to announce
            the creation of a new country. The introductory sentence states the Declaration's main purpose, to explain
            the colonists' right to revolution. In other words, <strong>“to declare the causes which impel them to the
                separation.”</strong> Congress had to prove the legitimacy of its cause. It had just defied the most
            powerful nation
            on Earth. It needed to motivate foreign allies to join the fight.</p>

        <h2>Why were the people upset</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those
                people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and
                formidable to tyrants only.</li>
            <li>He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the
                rights of the people.</li>
            <li>He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the
                depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his
                measures.

            </li>
            <li>He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.</li>
